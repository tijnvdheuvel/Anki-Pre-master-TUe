Contributing guideline:

- Add tags relevant to the topic. 
- referably stick to the usage of the "basic" and "basic &reverse" card types, e.g. properties don't need to have a reverse card since it fairly obvious.
- Add a short text regarding the topic e.g. "Definition" if the back is the definition of the front. That way we can keep the deck organized.
- Add cards to the relevant sub-decks. We can add extra sub-decks if needed just send something on discord.
